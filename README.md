# aceptadora

Aceptadora provides the boilerplate to orchestrate the containers around an acceptance test.

Aceptadora is a replacement for `docker-compose` in acceptance tests, and it also allows running and debugging tests from your IDE.

The acceptance tests of this package are an example of usage for this package.

# Motivations

We've been using `docker-compose` for acceptance tests for a long time, and while this approach did have issues[^1] we lived with it until the introduction of gRPC. 
Once we started playing with gRPC we found an issue: the gRPC golang client tries to connect to the service when the service is started, and if it fails, it will keep returning that error for a while. 
Since we started our test subjects before the acceptance-tester in the former approach, our test subjects failed to call the mocked gRPC servers on the acceptance-tester.

So, we created a library that restarted our test subject interacting with `docker` from the acceptance test itself.

Then, we found the need to restart multiple test subjects plus the complexity of having to handle two kinds of configurations (`docker-compose` for dependencies and `aceptadora` for test subjects) so we decided to extend the functionality of `aceptadora` to completely replace the `docker-compose` and allow managing the lifecycle of all dependencies from the test.

# Decisions

Everything in aceptadora accepts `t *testing.T` and everything does `require.NoError(t, err)` because in tests nobody's going to handle the errors anyway, so we apply a fail-fast strategy, removing the retured errors and keeping the API clean for clearer acceptance tests.

# Running

In order to handle multiple environments there are some stages in config loading. Notice that all the configs loaded expand the env vars set by `${VAR}` to their values from what's already loaded.

First, we load some very basic env-dependant config, deciding on env vars to load a local or gitlab config. 
This configuration mostly provides details about networking setup:
- Where can acceptance-tester reach the services? 
  Usually this would be `localhost`, but on Gitlab it's `docker` as we're running `dind`.
- Where can services reach the acceptance-tester? This will be set to the first local non-loopback IP address in the environment variable called `TESTER_ADDRESS`.
  You can set this variable to something more specific before running the test too, in which case it won't be overwritten. 

One may wonder: why don't we just decide all of that in `scripts/acceptance.sh`? 
The answer is that deciding that from the test itself allows us running the tests from any IDE as a normal test, instead of having a proxy script. 
Of course loading some env vars would work, but since `aceptadora` can do this for you, why should we care?

Then we load more env configs for the test itself, usually `acceptance.env`, which tells the acceptance test where the `aceptadora.yml` file is located, and how images from different docker registries are pulled.
Notice that `acceptance.env` can be specific to each suite you may have if their paths are different. 
You can load as many common configs as you want, loading an `acceptance.env` and then `../config/acceptance.env` for example.

Here `aceptadora.New()` would load the `aceptadora.yml` file from the provided dir and filename, and it will also set `${YAMLDIR}` variable for the yamls itself to be able to reference its configs and binds from where the yaml is located instead of from where the test is located: this allows us having multiple test suites in different folders using the same `aceptadora.yml` file.

Finally, we run services by just running `aceptadora.Run(ctx, "svc-name-in-the-yaml")`.

Aceptadora will also take care of stopping the services, you can call `aceptadora.Stop(ctx, svcName)` to stop one of them, or `StopAll(ctx)` to stop all the (still running) services.

[^1]: With `docker-compose` approach, test subjects and dependencies were not restarted between tests, so we had to have some suites depending on other ones, which made the tests flaky and slow.
