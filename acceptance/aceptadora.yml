    # ports is a usual mapping like in docker compose, notice that depending on the env it will be mapped on the localhost
    # or on whatever host is running the docker (like host `docker` in gitlab) so we don't bind the ports on 127.0.0.1
    # if you're really concerned about security, an option would be to define a MAYBE_BIND_PORT in each of the env vars files as:
    # linux.env/darwin.env: `MAYBE_BIND_PORT=127.0.0.1:` (ending with a colon)
    # gitlab.env: `MAYBE_BIND_PORT=` [empty]
    # and then bind ports as: `- ${MAYBE_BIND_PORTS}6379:6379`
